Sonic Battle, for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance
Story Mode Walkthrough, by jamescom1

Hello.  I liked this game, so I decided to create a walkthrough for it.  This 
document covers the battles in the Story Mode of the game; little to no 
information will be mentioned about the story.  This guide may contain 
"spoilers" for those who have not played the game.  Also, this guide is based 
on the U.S. release of Sonic Battle.  Though I cover every battle in the game, 
a lot of them are redundant, and there's little to say.  Seriously, in almost 
all the battles, I'll say "Strategy A," and that's what you'll use mostly.

When I wrote this guide, I assumed that Emerl would have minimal skills for a 
large part of the game.  Specifically, I used IQ200 Attack, IQ300 Attack, 
IQ400 Attack, Sonic Flare, and Sonic Eagle (a total of 60 Skill Points), and 
nothing more until around the end of Shadow's story.

|                             Player Characters                              |
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Sonic
Of course, in most video games, the main character of the series is almost 
always the "well-balanced" character of the game.  Sonic has a good set of 
moves.  His Ground Shot and Air Shot are unique:  right before the actual shot 
comes out, Sonic curls into a ball first.  This ball counts as a regular 
attack and cannot be auto-blocked by Shot Defense, therefore making it quite 
effective when combined with a full Ichikoro Gauge.  When using Ground Power, 
Sonic throws a ring in front of him.  Pressing the R button again shoots Sonic 
in the direction of the ring.

Tails
Tails uses his "inventions" to attack his opponents.  Tails seems to like 
hitting his opponents multiple times:  2nd Attack hits two times, Heavy Attack 
hits three times, and Ground Shot and Air Shot hit several times.  His Traps--
which look exactly like a certain character in Sega's ChuChu Rocket--walk 
toward an opponent and detonate; it is handy with Ichikoro.  His Air Attack 
not only hits three times, but also keeps Tails in the air; theoretically, 
Tails can use it indefinitely without landing.  His Dash Attack launches him 
into the air.

Knuckles
Knuckles is fairly unique in his attacks.  His 1st Attack, 2nd Attack, and 3rd 
Attack make him move forward a little, sometimes making him move past 
opponents, so be aware of that.  His Air Action does damage to opponents.  His 
Shot Special Attacks hit the ground a small distance away from Knuckles, 
reducing their effectiveness against close-range opponents.  His healing fills 
his Ichikoro Gauge relatively quickly.  His Traps drill into the ground, 
concealing themselves from view.

Shadow
Shadow is quite a powerful character with an above-average set of moves.  His 
3rd Attack knocks opponents into the air.  His Heavy Attack is powerful and 
looks cool, but it is a bit slow.  His Aim Attack not only is instantaneous, 
but also can hit opponents on the ground.  His Ground Power and Air Power hits 
multiple times and is powerful, too.  His Ground Power also can be used for 
stealth:  by holding the R button with the Ground Power active, Shadow turns 
invisible and will travel in the selected direction until the button is 
released.  Shadow's Traps follow Shadow, so nearby opponents may be hit by or 
even run into it, though since the game sprites are 2D, it may be hard to 
determine if someone is going to make contact with it.  Shadow's Air Attack 
can be used over and over again to hit opponents.

Rouge
The first thing you'll realize is that she actually floats in the air.  This 
may or may not be of any use to you.  Her Air Attack can be used indefinitely 
in the air.  Her Traps hover above an opponent; it is good for deterring Aim 
Attacks.  Her Dash Attack hits multiple times and can be used over and over 
again, creating an inescapable combo.  After hitting the opponent with her 
Ground Power, you can pursue and use Aim Attack, just like if you used her 
Heavy Attack.

Amy
With her Pikopiko Hammer, Amy is quite a contender in battles.  Her attacks 
are quick but a bit weaker than other characters'.  Her Air Shot can be used 
as a getaway tactic.  Amy can still move while using her Ground Power.  Her 
Dash Attack is slow but knocks opponents away and is kind of funny to watch.

Cream
Here is Cream, along with her pet Chao Cheese to aid her in the fight.  Many 
of her basic attacks (1st Attack, 2nd Attack, 3rd Attack, Heavy Attack, Upper 
Attack) are a little slow and not that powerful, though her Aim Attack is 
instantaneous.  Her Ground Power and Air Power are fairly powerful and knock 
back opponents.  Also, when Cream uses Air Power, she can still move.  More 
mobility is a definite plus.  Her Traps, which resemble Omochao, are also very 
powerful; too bad they are stationary.  Cream's Heal Skill is also good; 
Ichikoro fills up quickly, and damage-healing speed is average.  Cream can 
jump high.

E-102 Gamma
Apparently, this isn't the "real" E-102 Gamma.  It recalls no memory of 
"Gamma" in Amy's story, and Eggman does refer to it as Chaos Gamma in 
Knuckles's story and Cream's story...  For the purpose of this guide, I will 
continue to refer to it as E-102 Gamma.
Well anyway, Gamma explodes every time it is KO'ed.  This can be good or bad.  
On one hand, the explosion deals a great amount of damage to any nearby 
opponents; on the other hand, human players can easily push the L button to 
guard, so this feature is more helpful against CPU opponents.  Gamma's Dash 
Skill is very quick.  Gamma's Heal Skill recovers health very quickly.  Other 
than that, Gamma's other skills are rather slow compared to the other 
characters'.

Chaos
Chaos's attacks are a bit more powerful than the other characters' but are 
slow.  Its Run Skill is not much of a run; it's more like a slow walk.  Its 
Dash Skill is just as slow, but the skill makes Chaos invincible for a short 
while.  Chaos seems to be very heavy.

Emerl (default)
Obviously, Emerl is not very good at the beginning of the game.  Air Shot is 
surprisingly powerful, though.  It can KO in four hits (not taking any 
handicaps into account), and it cannot be blocked automatically by a Special 
Defense.  Air Power is nearly as powerful as well.  By using Ground Shot or 
Air Shot, Emerl can climb to higher elevations since he cannot jump high.  You 
can use Dash Attack to knock away opponents if they surround you.  Ground Trap 
and Air Trap actually hurt opponents; it's kind of funny to watch.

Emerl (Ultimate)
Emerl, loaded with all of his Ultimate Skills, isn't normally possible since 
that would exceed 500 Skill Points, the upper limit that is set by the game.  
Still, I'll describe some of the Ultimate Skills.  3rd Attack and Upper Attack 
are considered Shot Special Attacks, which means that they can utilize 
Ichikoro, and they can be blocked by Shot Defense.  3rd Attack, Upper Attack, 
and Air Power do not drain the Ichikoro Gauge, so you can potentially perform 
lots of one-hit KOs without having to recharge.  Ground Shot and Air Shot are 
powerful and hit multiple times; you can easily KO opponents with one shot.  
If you are KO'ed while executing Air Power, then you will kind of "float" in 
the air, and you will be unable to do anything until Game Set.  Too bad.

|                                 Strategies                                 |
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------/
I use three main strategies in this game against the CPU players.  These 
strategies are pretty common sense, but I decided to put them here anyway.  I 
will call these Strategy A, Strategy B, and Strategy C, just for the sake of 
naming them something.

Strategy A
This strategy involves an all-out attack against your opponent.  Run up to 
your opponent (or let him/her run up to you), and use your 1st Attack (B 
button), 2nd Attack, (B button again), 3rd Attack (B button again), and Heavy 
Attack (B button again).  When your opponent is knocked away (preferably into 
a wall), press the Control Pad in the direction he/she went in order to pursue 
the opponent, then press the B button once more to slam the opponent into the 
ground.  Be aware that it is possible for opponents to counterattack by 
rebounding off of a wall and then slamming you into the ground (and the CPUs 
are very good at doing just that), so you'll have to be quick with your 
pursuit.  Repeat as necessary.  True, this isn't much of a strategy, but it 
works...unless your opponent starts guarding against your attacks, which is 
especially deadly when you have two or more opponents.  If this strategy 
doesn't work for you, then try your luck with...

Strategy B
This strategy is more effective against one opponent rather than against two 
or more.  This strategy involves using your Special Attacks to exploit the 
CPU's less-than-stellar artificial intelligence.  First, attack your opponent 
with one Special Attack to see if he/she can defend the attack.  Traps are 
good for this purpose.  If the attack is successful, then keep using the same 
attack until you KO your opponent.  If the attack is blocked, then use your 
other Special Attack to KO your opponent.  Repeat as necessary.  To illustrate 
this, let's say that you are using Sonic as your character against Emerl.  
Sonic lays a Sonic Cracker behind him as he runs.  Emerl is hit and knocked 
into the air.  Sonic lays trap after trap right underneath Emerl until he is 
knocked out.  When Emerl returns, Sonic lays a Sonic Cracker behind him as he 
runs.  Emerl has a defense against traps.  Depending on what other Special 
Attack Sonic has equipped, Sonic can use Sonic Storm to repeatedly attack 
Emerl, or he can use Sonic Meteor to repeatedly knock Emerl into the air.  
Repeat as necessary.  If this doesn't suit you, then you can always try...

Strategy C
This strategy is easy to implement and is effective against the CPU opponents 
because they don't guard against Air Attacks.  This strategy involves certain 
Air Attacks--namely, Typhoon, Shadow Rocket, Agent Eagle, and Chao Circle—that 
can be repeatedly used over and over again such that your opponent or 
opponents will have a difficult time trying to hit back.  For Typhoon, jump 
into the air, and keep hitting the B button.  Typhoon will hit the opponent 
several times over while keeping you in the air.  Agent Eagle works similarly.  
Chao Circle is similar, though it doesn't stay in the air as well.  With 
Shadow Rocket, jump kick in one direction, then quickly jump kick in the other 
direction.  Keep doing that until the opponent is KO'ed.  Simple, wasn't it?

The preceding paragraphs are the three strategies that will more or less get 
you through Story Mode.  Basically, try Strategy A first, which should almost 
always work.  If it doesn't work, try Strategy B or Strategy C, or try a 
combination of strategies.  There may be some exceptions, such as having three 
opponents against you at once.  I will talk about such situations during those 
respective battles.  There are other strategies as well, such as repeatedly 
using Upper Attacks on your opponent or using Emerl's default Air Shot, but I 
mainly use the above three strategies.

/----------------------------------------------------------------------------\

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------/
The battles that are required to continue the story are numbered.  All other 
battles are labeled as optional.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 01 (Sonic's story)
Tails' House (Emerald Town)
Sonic and Emerl versus Shadow (3 lives)

Shadow is relatively easy and weak, at least in this battle.  This first 
battle is a good place for you to practice the game controls.  Or if you just 
want to end this battle quickly, then use Strategy A.  Overall, it should not 
be hard.  Emerl just stands there doing nothing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 02 (Sonic's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Sonic versus Rouge (3 lives)

Now, about Rouge...  See, after she takes flight, she may or may not try to 
attack you once, then she'll just wait in the air until she lands on the 
ground again, leaving herself completely vulnerable to attack.  So this battle 
is just as good as the last battle, in that you get to practice some more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 03 (Sonic's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Sonic versus Rouge (5 lives)

See Battle 02.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 04 (Sonic's story)
Tails' Lab (Emerald Town)
Sonic versus Phi (5 lives)

This will be one of your easiest battles because Phi is so extremely weak that 
it can't even perform any attacks properly.  Pretty much anything you do here 
should result in a win.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 05 (Sonic's story)
Tails' Lab (Emerald Town)
Sonic versus Emerl (2 minutes)

The objective here is to hit Emerl with five Heavy Attacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 06 (Sonic's story)
Tails' Lab (Emerald Town)
Sonic versus Emerl (2 minutes)

The objective here is to hit Emerl with five Upper Attacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 07 (Sonic's story)
Tails' Lab (Emerald Town)
Sonic versus Emerl versus Tails (10 KOs)

Again, this battle shouldn't be too hard.  Emerl can't hurt you much, so worry 
more about Tails.  Use Strategy A, or start coming up with your own strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Sonic's story)
Tails' Lab (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Tails versus Sonic (10 KOs)

This battle probably won't profit you much as Emerl is still very weak.  He 
has very few Skill Points, and so he will have very few Skills.  But practice 
makes perfect, and Emerl will gain more Skill Points with every battle, even a 
lost battle, so the choice is up to you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 08 (Sonic's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Sonic versus Emerl versus Tails (10 KOs)

See Battle 07.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Sonic's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Sonic versus Tails (10 KOs)

You can try out some of your captured data if you wish.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 09 (Sonic's story)
Tails' House (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Phi (1 life)

Before you start this battle, you should equip Sonic Flare or another Heavy 
Attack if you haven't already.  This battle is very easy because, even though 
you're still very weak, Phi is also very weak.  You can use Sonic Flare or a 
similar attack a few times for an easy KO.  You can even use Sonic Up Draft if 
you'd rather use that.

NOTE:  Since Battle 09 is only a one-life battle, you can use it to increase 
your Skill Points a little bit more quickly if you have good attacks.  For 
example, I was lucky enough to have Chaos Nightmare (Shadow's Heavy Attack) as 
well as Sonic Eagle, so I was able to KO Phi quickly.  Finish Battle 09, then 
when Battle 10 comes, quit the battle.  You will return to the point right 
before Battle 09.  Doing this, I was able to gain five Skill Points about 
every 45 seconds.  Yes, it is boring, but that's the price you pay for 
efficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 10 (Sonic's story)
Tails' House (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Phi (3 lives)

Phi actually attempts to counter your Heavy Attacks now, but even so, Phi is 
still too weak to do much damage.  Do the same thing you did in the last 
battle.

NOTE:  Since Battle 09 is only a one-life battle, you can use it to increase 
your Skill Points a little bit more quickly if you have good attacks.  For 
example, I was lucky enough to have Chaos Nightmare (Shadow's Heavy Attack) as 
well as Sonic Eagle, so I was able to KO Phi quickly.  Finish Battle 09, then 
when Battle 10 comes, quit the battle.  You will return to the point right 
before Battle 09.  Doing this, I was able to gain five Skill Points about 
every 45 seconds.  Yes, it is boring, but that's the price you pay for 
efficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Sonic's story)
Ruins (Holy Summit)
Emerl versus Sonic versus Tails (10 KOs)

Unfortunately, this may be a required training session if you're not strong 
enough to defeat Knuckles.  You may also go back to Emerald Beach or Tails' 
Lab if you prefer those training areas.  You probably don't have much data or 
Skill Points yet, but you still have more than you did before.  Try them out; 
try to mix-and-match the various moves you have collected thus far, and see if 
any of them are to your liking.  Battle for more data and Skill Points.  In 
case you're wondering, you get five Skill Points if you are not hit at all, 
two Skill Points if you are not KO'ed, and one Skill Point otherwise.  Now, as 
for the actual battle here, a good strategy is to Heavy Attack an opponent 
into a wall, then follow-up with a Pursuit Attack such as Sonic Eagle or Tails 
Dunk.  Just think of this as standard level-up training in role-playing games; 
the more you battle, the more options you will have at your disposal in the 
battles to come.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 11 (Sonic's story)
Plains (Holy Summit)
Sonic and Emerl and Tails versus E-102 Gamma (5 lives)

If you wish to train some more, you can run ahead to the Ruins, but eventually 
you must come back here to fight Gamma.  This should be a relatively easy 
fight since you have two allies to help you, and Gamma isn't too bright in 
this match, either.  The one thing you must watch out for will happen whenever 
Gamma is KO'ed.  He will say, "Initiating recovery mode," and then self-
destruct, severely damaging anyone nearby.  It is possible to block the 
explosion by Guarding (L button), and in fact, I encourage you to do that.  
Learn to do that in this battle while CPU opponents are relatively weak and 
dumb, especially since you have two allies to back you up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 12 (Sonic's story)
Plains (Holy Summit)
Sonic and Emerl and Tails versus E-102 Gamma (10 lives)

In case you somehow missed the above, I'll repeat what I said.  If you wish to 
train some more, you can run ahead to the Ruins, but eventually you must come 
back here to fight Gamma.  This should be a relatively easy fight since you 
have two allies to help you, and Gamma isn't too bright in this match, either.  
The one thing you must watch out for will happen whenever Gamma is KO'ed.  He 
will say, "Initiating recovery mode," and then self-destruct, severely 
damaging anyone nearby.  It is possible to block the explosion by Guarding (L 
button), and in fact, I encourage you to do that.  Learn to do that in this 
battle while CPU opponents are relatively weak and dumb, especially since you 
have two allies to back you up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 13 (Sonic's story)
Knuckles' House (Holy Summit)
Emerl versus Knuckles (5 lives)

Knuckles may possibly be the easiest character to defeat (besides perhaps a 
CPU-controlled Rouge or an undeveloped Emerl).  It depends on what moves you 
have collected and if you have the necessary Skill Points to load them.  
Anyway, if you could beat both Sonic and Tails, then you should clear this 
challenge without much problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 14 (Sonic's story)
Knuckles' House (Holy Summit)
Emerl versus Knuckles (10 lives)

Knuckles is a bit harder in this battle, sometimes guarding against your 
attacks.  I hope you've managed to obtain some good moves to make this battle 
a bit easier.  If not, then keep trying with Heavy Attacks and Pursuit Attacks, 
or do some more training.

This is the last battle in Sonic's story.

NOTE:  If you still don't feel confident about Emerl, then you can choose to 
repeat Sonic's story over again.  The CPU opponents are easiest in Sonic's 
story, you'll have an easier time gaining Skill Points with Sonic than with 
Emerl (potentially five Skill Points per battle), and you'll keep receiving 
the ten Skill Points that come with the first Chaos Emerald.  Doing this may 
make the game much easier for you because of all the extra Skill Points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 15 (Tails's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Tails versus Emerl versus Sonic (10 KOs)

Okay, time to fly!

This is an easy battle, so use this opportunity to get used to Tails's moves.  
A cheap but effective tactic is to continually use Tails's Air Attack, Typhoon 
(see Strategy C).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Tails's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town), Tails' Lab (Emerald Town), Central Highway
Emerl versus Sonic versus Tails (10 KOs)

Here's yet another place to get beaten by Sonic and Tails, though if you have 
any Heavy Attack and Aim Attack other than the defaults, then it's possible to 
win.  Just Heavy Attack them into the wall and then Aim Attack them into the 
ground (pretty much a condensed version of Strategy A).  If you have 1st 
Attack, 2nd Attack, and 3rd Attack data, then you can use Strategy A.  Or you 
can try Strategy C.

Also, Tails' Lab is still open from Sonic's story.  If you go there, then 
you'll fight only Tails (since Sonic is at Emerald Beach).

If you go to Central City now, then Central Highway will offer the same 
conditions as Tails' Lab, except that it's a different stage of course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Tails's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Tails and Emerl versus Phi (5 lives), or
Tails and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

If you want to fight Phi, you should go here before going to Central Lab.  The 
Crossing is on the way to Central Lab, so you might as well stop by.

Okay, here's where Phi starts to make its presence known.  Phi copies the 
entire moveset of one of the characters in the game, even ones you haven't met 
yet.  So you could be fighting Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, Rouge, Amy, 
Cream, or E-102 Gamma.  If you hear the clanking of metal, that's a Gamma copy, 
and don't forget that Gamma self-destructs when KO'ed.  Strategy A should be 
sufficient enough to take out Phi, or just use Typhoon.

If you're bored with using Emerl to fight Sonic and Tails, then try this 
battle.  Personally, I find the battles with Phi more fun than other battles.

Note:  If you fight Phi and either lose or quit the battle, Phi will not give 
up, and the battle will restart.  Since the game automatically saves after 
every battle, you should be able to reset the GameBoy without loss of data if 
you wish to quit the battle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 16 (Tails's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Tails and Emerl versus Rouge (10 KOs)

After going to Central Lab, return to the Crossing.  Rouge awaits you.

Rouge is easy enough to KO without using definite strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 17 (Tails's story)
Central Lab (Central City)
Tails and Emerl versus Guard Robo (10 lives)

Guard Robo is exactly like E-102 Gamma, except it has no color, and it gives 
no audible warning when it's about to self-destruct, so beware.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 18 (Tails's story)
Central Lab (Central City)
Tails and Emerl versus Guard Robo and Guard Robo (5 lives)

Be on your guard here.  Try not to let them surround you, and try not to get 
hit by Guard Robo's explosion when it loses a life.  Since there are now two 
Guard Robos self-destructing, they can take you out fairly quickly.  If you're 
not good at this game yet, then you may lose this battle.  Just keep trying, 
and remember to abuse Typhoon.  If you win, then...you must be getting 
stronger!  (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 19 (Tails's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Tails and Emerl versus Guard Robo and Guard Robo (5 lives)

The Guard Robos here are a little bit stronger than the ones in the last 
battle.  Again, if you're not good at this game yet, then you may lose this 
battle.  Just keep trying, and remember to abuse Typhoon.  If you win, 
then...you must be getting stronger!  (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Tails's story)
Central Lab (Central City)
Tails and Emerl versus Phi (5 lives)

Same thing as the last Phi battle.  In case you didn't see it...

Okay, here's where Phi starts to make its presence known.  Phi copies the 
entire moveset of one of the characters in the game, even ones you haven't met 
yet.  So you could be fighting Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, Rouge, Amy, 
Cream, or E-102 Gamma.  If you hear the clanking of metal, that's a Gamma copy, 
and don't forget that Gamma self-destructs when KO'ed.  Strategy A should be 
sufficient enough to take out Phi, or just use Typhoon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 20 (Tails's story)
Central Highway (Central City)
Tails and Emerl versus Shadow (10 lives)

I think Shadow's AI is at the highest CPU level (or pretty close).  His Heavy 
Attack and Aim Attack are quite strong, and he tends to guard against your 
attacks.  Just be glad that Shadow doesn't have a teammate.  Once again, if 
you're having trouble beating him, just Typhoon him to death, mwa ha ha!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 21 (Tails's story)
Office (Central City)
Tails and Emerl versus Guard Robo (10 lives)

Just one Guard Robo here.  However, this Guard Robo's AI is at the same level 
as Shadow's was in the previous battle, and this Guard Robo is even more 
powerful than the other Guard Robos.  You may want to consider Strategy B here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 22 (Tails's story)
Knuckles' House (Holy Summit)
Emerl versus Knuckles (10 KOs)

You've come a long way since the last battle with Knuckles.  By this point, 
you should have enough Skills and Skill Points that Knuckles should not pose 
much of a problem.  Stick with Strategy A or Strategy B.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 23 (Tails's story)
Bridge (Holy Summit)
Tails and Emerl and Knuckles versus E-102 Gamma (5 lives)

Oh come now.  Three-on-one is hardly fair, heh heh.  One strategy you can do 
here is to use Tails's Ground Shot and Air Trap Specials to attack Gamma from 
a safe distance while Emerl and Knuckles pummel Gamma head-on.  The only 
reason to do this is to ensure winning five Skill Points; otherwise, you may 
attack at will.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 24 (Tails's story)
Bridge (Holy Summit)
Tails and Emerl and Knuckles versus E-102 Gamma (10 lives)

See Battle 23.

This is the last battle in Tails's story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 25 (Rouge's story)
Central Highway (Central City)
Rouge versus Phi (5 lives)

This battle is like the first Phi battle in Sonic's story; it's very easy 
since Phi has no skills.

The next part of the story is at the Central Lab, but you can fight Phi some 
more now if you want to, though there's no reward for doing so.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Rouge's story)
Office (Central City), Crossing (Central City), Central Highway (Central City)
Rouge versus Phi (5 lives), or
Rouge versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

This isn't very hard; it gets harder in later stories.  Strategy A will 
suffice here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 26 (Rouge's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Rouge versus Emerl and Amy (5 KOs)

Since you will be fighting Emerl, you may want to change Emerl's skills to 
your benefit before this battle.

Here's your first battle with Rouge as your character.  Rouge is unique, in 
that she floats in the air.  This battle isn't too hard, either.  Just like 
with Tails, here's the cheap strategy for Rouge:  keep using her Air Attack, 
Agent Eagle.  After you're ahead by a few KOs, try out some of her Special 
Attacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 27 (Rouge's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Rouge versus Emerl and Amy (10 KOs)

See Battle 26.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 28 (Rouge's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Rouge and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (5 lives)

If Emerl is somewhat competent in his ability to attack (i.e. he can use 
Strategy A without much problem), then Emerl could probably take on E-102 
Gamma by himself, perhaps with some long-range support from Rouge's Beauty 
Shock, or you can use Strategy A, or you can use Agent Eagle, whatever works 
for you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 29 (Rouge's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Rouge and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (10 lives)

See Battle 28.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 30 (Rouge's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Rouge and Emerl versus Amy (5 lives)

Yes, Amy's back, but this time Emerl is on your side.  It's kind of strange 
seeing Amy and Emerl battling each other, when they were teammates just a 
couple of battles ago...oh well.

Again, if Emerl is somewhat competent in his ability to attack, then he could 
probably take on Amy by himself with minimal assistance from you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 31 (Rouge's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Emerl versus Guard Robo (2 minutes)

Your objective here is to KO the Guard Robo five times within the two-minute 
time limit.  Note that even if you obtain the five KOs, the match will not end 
until the two minutes are up.  If you do not wish to wait for the two minutes 
to end, then simply pause and quit the battle when you have five KOs.  You 
will still advance to the next battle.

If, for some reason, you still do not have any Special Attacks loaded, then 
this battle may be a bit harder for you.  Try to stick with Strategy A.  If 
the Guard Robo is guarding against your attacks, then wait until the Guard 
Robo attacks you.  The Guard Robo's attacks are quite slow compared to the 
other characters, so if you have a fast finger (or thumb, I guess), then you 
can hit the Guard Robo while it's trying to hit you.

If you have at least two different Special Attacks, and Strategy A is giving 
you a hard time, then try Strategy B.  If you have an appropriate Air Attack, 
then try Strategy C.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 32 (Rouge's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Emerl versus Rouge (2 minutes)

THIS IS THE EASIEST BATTLE IN THE GAME, even easier than Battle 05 and 06!  
Apparently there was an oversight in the programming of this battle...

The objective of this battle is to run away from Rouge for two minutes.  If 
you get hit even once, then you must restart the battle.  If you have a fast 
Run Skill (such as Sonic's or Shadow's) or a fast Dash Skill (such as Shadow's 
or E-102 Gamma's), then it shouldn't be too hard to run away from Rouge.  If 
you're not so fast, then you might have your work cut out for you.  One method 
is to make Rouge stay in the air for as long as possible.  If there is a wall 
between you and Rouge, then she'll jump in the air to follow you.  So it seems 
that the only choices are either to use a high-level Run Skill or to go 
through a lot of pain and frustration.  But why bother with either?

As soon as the battle starts (or whenever you feel like moving on), pause and 
quit the battle.  You will automatically win!  How about that?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 33 (Rouge's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Emerl versus Rouge (1 life / 5 KOs)

Despite this being a five-KO battle, you only have one life to complete this 
battle; otherwise, you must restart the battle.  (Did I say "battle" too 
much?)

If you are able to, I recommend that you use Strategy B or Strategy C here.  
If you take her head-on, she may guard against your attacks and retaliate.  If 
you are intent on not loading any Special Attack data, then use Emerl's 
default Air Shot.  It is surprisingly strong; it can KO Rouge in four hits, 
and Rouge cannot defend and will never guard against it.  And since Rouge 
doesn't attack in the air, Air Shot is perfect for this scenario.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 34 (Rouge's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Rouge and Emerl versus Amy (3 lives)

She's very persistent, isn't she?

This is Battle 30 all over again.  Two-on-one battle; it's no contest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 35 (Rouge's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Rouge and Emerl versus Amy and Sonic (10 lives)

In case you're wondering, no, that's not really Sonic.  Apparently, Amy is 
becoming delusional, and she is "imagining" that Sonic is there, though this 
battle seems real enough.  Go figure.

I am convinced that the CPU level here is at the maximum, so unless you either 
are an expert at this game (in which case, you wouldn't need this guide) or 
have a very good Emerl (with good movement, attacks, specials; the works), 
then you may have to completely rely on Agent Eagle.  So use that Air Attack 
like there's no tomorrow!  If you decide not to use it, then I really can't 
help you; you'll have to get better at fighting max-level CPU opponents.

If all of Rouge's lives are gone, the battle ends regardless of how many lives 
Emerl has remaining.  Keep that in mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Rouge's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Emerl versus Rouge (10 KOs)

There isn't much reason to come here, except to train Emerl of course, but 
there are better places to train that are easier and faster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 36 (Rouge's story)
Building (Emerald Town)
Rouge versus Sonic (10 lives)

This should be pretty easy for you.  Time for Strategy A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 37 (Rouge's story)
Building (Emerald Town)
Rouge versus Sonic and Tails and Knuckles (5 lives)

You against the Sonic Heroes, heh.

Actually, this battle isn't as hard as it seems.  The CPU level is quite low; 
they hardly guard at all, at least not like in Battle 35.  In fact, sometimes 
one or more of the CPU players will stand in one part of the stage doing 
absolutely nothing (sometimes healing, sometimes not).  If this happens, don't 
go near that area.  First, take out the other opponent(s) who do come after 
you (all five lives), then go finish off the remaining opponent(s).  It is 
quite possible to KO all of them using Strategy A.  If you find yourself 
having a hard time winning this battle, then you can always use Agent Eagle on 
all of them.

This is the last battle in Rouge's story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 38 (Knuckles's story)
Tails' Lab (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Knuckles (10 KOs)

Very easy battle here.  You can use Strategy A here.  If you have other skills, 
you can use those, too.  You can pretty much do anything you want here and 
still win.  I told you it was easy.  Don't worry; there are harder battles 
later in this story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 39 (Knuckles's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Knuckles and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (5 lives)

This battle shouldn't be too hard, and with Emerl to back you up, this is as 
good a time as any to practice using Knuckles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 40 (Knuckles's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Knuckles and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (10 lives)

Again, use this time to become familiar to Knuckles's moves and style of 
attack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Knuckles's story)
Amy's Room (Central City)
Knuckles and Emerl versus Phi (5 lives), or
Knuckles and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

Why Phi is at Amy's Room is anyone's guess...  Actually, it looks like you're 
fighting outside of Amy's Room...  Whatever.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Knuckles's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Knuckles versus Sonic (10 KOs)

Some more training.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Knuckles's story)
Tails' Lab (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Knuckles versus Tails (10 KOs)

Some more training.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Knuckles's story)
Casino (Night Babylon), Theater (Night Babylon), Hotel (Night Babylon)
Knuckles and Emerl versus Phi (5 lives), or
Knuckles and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

You're supposed to go to the Bar next; if you go anywhere else besides where 
you're supposed to go in Night Babylon, you are greeted by a Phi or two.  Phi 
seems a bit tougher to beat than previously, but this could be because I'm not 
that good with Knuckles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 41 (Knuckles's story)
Bar (Night Babylon)
Knuckles and Emerl versus Guard Robo and Guard Robo (3 lives)

It seems like your opponents are getting a little stronger.  Try alternating 
between Strategy A and Strategy B, and make sure the two Guard Robos don't 
surround you.  Even if you don't succeed the first time, this is only a three-
life battle, so you'll eventually win.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 42 (Knuckles's story)
Theater (Night Babylon)
Knuckles versus Guard Robo and Guard Robo (3 lives)

Okay, now it gets a little harder now that you're by yourself.  A fairly good 
method of attack is to keep using your Heavy Attack and only your Heavy 
Attack; don't even bother pursuing them.  They will rarely guard against your 
attack.  And again, this is only a three-life battle, so it'll be over quickly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 43 (Knuckles's story)
Hotel (Night Babylon)
Knuckles versus Guard Robo and Guard Robo and Guard Robo (3 lives)

Wow, another battle against three opponents, and Knuckles can't abuse his Air 
Attack like some other characters can.  Again, a fairly good method of attack 
is to repeatedly use your Heavy Attack; don't even bother pursuing them.  They 
will rarely guard against your attack.  Don't ever let them surround you.  
This battle may be kind of annoying, but it is kind of fun chucking boulders 
at them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 44 (Knuckles's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Emerl versus Rouge (10 KOs)

Strategy A is sufficient enough, or you can try using Air Shot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 45 (Knuckles's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Knuckles and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

Well, there's nothing much to be said here.  Emerl is back, so battles will be 
easier.  Use Strategy A, or just attack them however you wish.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Knuckles's story)
Crossing (Central City), Amy's Room (Central City)
Knuckles and Emerl versus Phi (5 lives), or
Knuckles and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

The usual Phi battles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Knuckles's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Knuckles versus Sonic (10 KOs)

Some more beating up of Sonic and Knuckles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 46 (Knuckles's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Knuckles (1 KO)

Strategy A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 47 (Knuckles's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Knuckles and Emerl versus Phi (10 lives)

Strategy A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 48 (Knuckles's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Knuckles and Emerl versus Phi (10 lives)

Strategy A.  (I'm sensing a pattern here.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Knuckles's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Emerl versus Knuckles versus Rouge (10 KOs)

Some more training if you want.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 49 (Knuckles's story)
Depot (Gimme Shelter)
Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (5 lives)

When Gamma said, "Power output max.  Energy flow at 150%," he wasn't kidding.  
He is quite strong and can KO you quickly.  Fortunately, he's not much smarter 
than before.  Just using Strategy A should be enough to get you through this 
battle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 50 (Knuckles's story)
Depot (Gimme Shelter)
Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (10 lives)

When Gamma said, "Power output at 200%!  Energy flow at 200%!", he wasn't 
kidding.  He is quite strong and can KO you quickly.  His self-destruction 
will drain almost all of your health:  90% or more.  He also has more defense 
and will take more hits before going down, and with ten lives, Gamma is a 
formidable opponent.  Fortunately, you can still use Strategy A; he's still 
not much smarter than before.

This is the last battle in Knuckles's story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 51 (Amy's story)
Beach (Emerald Town)
Amy and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

From Amy's story onward, both the CPU level and the handicap will really start 
to go against you, so if you've been having difficulty thus far, then you must 
get better at this game.  I just love pointing out the obvious.

This battle is not very hard.  Use Strategy A here, and you should be the 
winner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 52 (Amy's story)
Beach (Emerald Town)
Amy and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

Of course you have to fight them again.  And again, they're not very hard.  
Use Strategy A here, and you should end up the winner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Amy's story)
Emerald Beach (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Amy (10 KOs)

Some more training here.  You can start collecting Amy's data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Amy's story)
Tails' Lab (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus Amy versus Tails (10 KOs)

Hmm, strange.  A few minutes ago, it seemed like Tails was terrified of Amy.  
Now, Tails is friendly again.  Oh well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 53 (Amy's story)
Amy's Room (Central City)
Emerl versus Amy (5 KOs)

Surprisingly or not, Amy's actually a good fighter.  But just keep using 
Strategy A, and this battle will end quickly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 54 (Amy's story)
Amy's Room (Central City)
Emerl versus Amy (10 KOs)

More of the same from the last battle.  Strategy A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Amy's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Emerl versus Phi (5 lives), or
Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

Unless you have very good Skills loaded, you may want to avoid this optional 
battle.  You don't win any Skills here, and there are better places to earn 
Skill Points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 55 (Amy's story)
Amy's Room (Central City)
Emerl versus Cream versus Amy (10 KOs)

What?  Cream fights as well?  Yes, she does!  (Well, at least I was 
surprised.)  Surprisingly or not, Cream is a good fighter, too.  Not only do 
her Special Attacks hurt, but also her Aim Attack is immediate.  Even against 
two opponents, this battle shouldn't be too hard.  Again, Strategy A is your 
best friend.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 56 (Amy's story)
Amy's Room (Central City)
Emerl versus Cream versus Amy (10 KOs)

This battle can be quite an annoyance, especially if you only have low-level 
skills (obviously, everything would be easy if you had the high-level skills).  
Remember Battle 50 in the previous story, how Gamma suddenly became more 
powerful?  Well, the same thing happens here, except now you get to fight two 
opponents--oh joy.  Both of them can KO you in a few hits, and it will take 
you many hits to KO them.  The fact that this is a KO battle doesn't help, 
either:  not only must you KO them before they KO you, but also you must KO 
them before they KO each other.  I have been able to win here using Strategy A 
with basic low-level attacks (described at the top of this guide), but just 
barely.  Try Strategy B or Strategy C.  If not, then there's not much I can 
think of that would help you here.  In fact, the way I won this battle the 
first time I played was to go back and get more Skill Points, then load as 
many good Skills as I can and unleash all of them against Amy and Cream.  It 
worked, though I spent a great deal of time gaining Skill Points--Sonic's 
story is the best place for Skill Points in my opinion.

If you are laughing at me right now because you found this battle easy, 
then...go away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 57 (Amy's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Amy and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (10 lives)

Since Emerl is helping you out here, this battle isn't very hard.  Just keep 
using Strategy A, and all will be well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 58 (Amy's story)
Signboard (Night Babylon)
Amy and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

This duo is formidable.  Try to mix your attacks, meaning you should use both 
basic and special attacks against them (or use both Strategy A and Strategy B, 
whatever works in your head).  This isn't as tough as Battle 56, but Phi and 
Phi will put up a fight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 59 (Amy's story)
Signboard (Night Babylon)
Amy and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (10 lives)

See Battle 58.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 60 (Amy's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Amy and Emerl versus Rouge (10 lives)

You don't need help for this.  Trust me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 61 (Amy's story)
Club "Rouge" (Night Babylon)
Emerl versus Rouge (10 KOs)

This battle has a stipulation:  you must not use any Special Attacks.  Give 
the R button a rest.  You also cannot use any attacks that function as Special 
Attacks; namely, Ultimate 3rd Attack and Ultimate Upper Attack are prohibited 
(if you happen to have them).  However, you are allowed to use the special 
Combo skills, even though they are categorized as Ground Power.

This is the last battle in Amy's story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 62 (Cream's story)
Workshop (Gimme Shelter)
Emerl versus Guard Robo and Guard Robo (5 lives)

The stories only get harder from here, but these Guard Robos shouldn't be too 
hard for you.  Seriously, Strategy A works in almost every battle, and this 
one is no exception.  Just remember to watch out for the self-destructions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 63 (Cream's story)
Laboratory (Gimme Shelter)
Emerl and Cream versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

What?  Cream is a pacifist?  That's right, Cream will not fight; she will do 
absolutely nothing except get hit.  But don't worry about Cream losing lives; 
as long as Emerl survives, you will win the battle.  The Phi robots seem to go 
after Emerl anyway.  Actually, using only Strategy A here might not be enough 
for you to win (of course, experts would do fine).  You should use some 
Special Attacks; you must have some good ones by now, right?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 64 (Cream's story)
Laboratory (Gimme Shelter)
Emerl and Cream versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

See Battle 63.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Cream's story)
Laboratory (Gimme Shelter)
Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

Optional battle; looks like Cream is not participating this time.  This should 
be easier than the last battle, but you still get little reward from Phi.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 65 (Cream's story)
Workshop (Gimme Shelter)
Emerl and Cream versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

See Battle 64, heh heh.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 66 (Cream's story)
Laboratory (Gimme Shelter)
Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

Cream is sitting out of this battle.  Other than that, see Battle 65.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 67 (Cream's story)
Duct (Gimme Shelter)
Cream and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (5 lives)

What?  Cream's fighting now?  Whoa...

Here's your first chance at using Cream.  Get used to her style of attack 
while Emerl stands there doing nothing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 68 (Cream's story)
Depot (Gimme Shelter)
Cream versus Emerl (10 KOs)

Time to train.  Get used to Cream's moveset some more.  If you want an easy 
battle (and I mean EASY), then remove all of Emerl's skills before coming to 
the Depot.  But what fun is that?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Cream's story)
Laboratory (Gimme Shelter), Workshop (Gimme Shelter), Computer (Gimme Shelter)
Cream and Emerl versus Phi and Phi (5 lives)

This is probably my favorite place to train; the Phi robots keep changing 
their moveset, so the battles aren't always the same, not to mention that I 
like Cream.  (What?  She's cute.)  Try to capture Cream Heal if you haven't 
already.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 69 (Cream's story)
Depot (Gimme Shelter)
Cream versus Emerl (10 KOs)

See Battle 68.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 70 (Cream's story)

Cream versus Emerl (10 KOs)

See Battle 69.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 71 (Cream's story)
Duct (Gimme Shelter)
Cream and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (5 lives)

Use Strategy A.  This battle should be easy for you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 72 (Cream's story)
Duct (Gimme Shelter)
Cream and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma and Guard Robo (10 lives)

Uh oh, Gamma brought a friend.  And of course, the handicap is set against you, 
A LOT.  Their 1st Attack alone drains about 30% of your health; their Aim 
Attack will drain 90% or so of your health, and their self-destruction will KO 
you instantly.  Now this is a REAL battle.  Think of this battle as a test, 
and see if you can win without my help; you must have some skill of your own 
by now, right?  No, of course you don't; that's why you're here reading this 
guide.  (I'm just kidding.)  The easiest way (that I can think of) to win this 
battle is to keep using Cream's Air Attack.  Also, use Cream's Special Attacks, 
they're quite effective.

This is the last battle in Cream's story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 73 (Shadow's story)
Computer (Gimme Shelter)
Shadow and Rouge versus Guard Robo and Guard Robo (10 lives)

Shadow...oh my gosh...the sheer strength...so strong...raw power...

...Uh, I mean, Shadow is a pretty decent fighter.  Anyway, here's the usual 
warm-up battle where you can try out a new character's moves, Shadow's.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 74 (Shadow's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Shadow and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (10 lives)

Get used to Shadow some more, or else use Strategy A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 75 (Shadow's story)
Crossing (Central City)
Shadow and Emerl versus E-102 Gamma (10 lives)

See Battle 74.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 76 (Shadow's story)
Computer (Gimme Shelter)
Shadow versus Emerl (10 KOs)

This should be an easy battle, unless maybe you gave Emerl all the best skills 
in the game. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 77-82 (Shadow's story)
(various locations)
Emerl versus Sonic/Tails/Knuckles/Rouge/Amy/Cream (10 KOs)

The objective is to defeat each of them.  Don't worry; these one-on-one 
battles are very easy.  Just keep using Strategy A, and you'll win all of them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 83 (Shadow's story)
Central Highway (Central City)
Emerl versus Shadow (10 KOs)

Shadow is one tough character.  Try using a combination of strategies; try to 
combine Strategy A, Strategy B, and Strategy C.  Try to mix your attacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 84 (Shadow's story)
Central Highway (Gimme Shelter)
Emerl versus Sonic and Shadow (10 KOs)

Obviously, the previous battle wasn't difficult enough for you, so not only do 
you have two opponents to fight, but also the steep handicap returns, making 
this battle quite a challenge.  Your plan of attack here will depend on the 
Skills you have.  Again, try to mix your attacks.

This is the last battle in Shadow's story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Emerl's story)
Crater (Holy Summit)
Emerl versus Chaos (10 KOs)

Huh?  Chaos just "appeared" for some reason.  Oh well, now you can get Chaos's 
skills.  The handicap is set to the maximum against you.  Well, maybe not to 
the maximum, but Chaos can KO you very easily, so be wary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Emerl's story)
(various locations)
Emerl versus Sonic/Tails/Knuckles/Shadow/Rouge/Amy/Cream/E-102 Gamma (10 KOs)

Here's your last chance to train before the final battle; once you teleport to 
the Death Egg, there's no turning back.  Well, actually, that's not entirely 
true; you can always reset the game, but that's beside the point.

The battles are easy, so no worries there.  If you are missing some non-Rare 
Skills, then you may want to consider training here.  ("Training?"  I play too 
much Pokémon, heh.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Battle (Emerl's story)
Tails' Lab (Emerald Town)
Emerl versus all (? lives)

Virtual Training.  Some people call it "VT" for short.

The good news is that if you successfully complete Virtual Training, then you 
are guaranteed to get a Rare Skill:  namely, one of the "Ultimate" Skills.  
You can attempt Virtual Training as many times as you wish, so theoretically 
you can receive as many Ultimate Skills as you wish.

The bad news is that it's hard...very hard...extremely hard...and frustrating.  
So is it worth it?  Well, if you get the Rare Skills that you want, then I 
guess it's worth it.

I will not cover Virtual Training; there are other guides that do a better job 
than I could.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 85 (Emerl's story)
Death Egg
Emerl versus Dr. Eggman (5 lives)

For those who cannot figure out how to get to the Death Egg, go to Holy Summit 
and look at the sky; you should see the Death Egg.  (Actually, it took me a 
while to figure that out.)

Eggman fires missiles and bombs.  He floats like Rouge does, and he self-
destructs like E-102 Gamma does, except Eggman explodes multiple times, so 
watch out for that.  Eggman is not very difficult at all.  If you're having a 
difficult time, try Strategy B; else, hit him with everything you have.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 86 (Emerl's story)
Death Egg
Emerl versus Dr. Eggman (10 lives)

Here we go with the handicap again.  Of course, Eggman becomes more powerful 
and can KO you much more easily now.  Again, if you're having a difficult time, 
try Strategy B; else, hit him with everything you have.  Don't give him a 
chance to release missiles or bombs because they are quite damaging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle 87 (Emerl's story)
Death Egg
Sonic versus Emerl (10 lives)

Now this is interesting.  Emerl is overflowing with energy and has ALL of his 
Ultimate Skills.  Add in the handicap, and you have the final battle, right 
here.  The easiest way to defeat Emerl is to use Strategy B.  See the 
Strategies section of this guide for how to do just that.

This is the last battle in Emerl's story.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------/
"Oddities?"  Yeah, well, I didn't want to say glitches...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During one scenario in Rouge's story, where Emerl must evade Rouge for two 
minutes without getting hit, you will automatically win if you pause and quit 
the battle.  This may work in other battles as well (such as the first battle 
in Tails's story).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are KO'ed while using the Ult. Air Power skill, then you will 
perpetually "hang" in the air, and your character will not respond until Game 
Set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usually, to perform an Upper Attack in the direction you're facing, you press 
back on the Control Pad and the B button.  But, if you press back, either up 
or down, and the B button, then you'll perform an Upper Attack in the 
direction you pressed.  It is handy with Ult. Uppr Attack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emerl's default Air Shot and Air Power are absurdly powerful; they can KO an 
opponent in four and five hits, respectively (discounting any handicaps or 
Attack/Strength Support).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The English descriptions for Attack Support 0 and Strength Support 0 are 
swapped.  Similarly, the French descriptions of the Ultimate Skills have 
switched places with the German descriptions of the Ultimate Skills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are subtle differences between the Japanese and U.S. versions of Sonic 
Battle.  For example, "Holly Summit" has been changed to "Holy Summit."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Rouge's story, Dr. Eggman incorrectly refers to Phi as E-121.  It should be 
E-120.

Version 1.00 – June 18, 2004
    I finally submitted my FAQ for the first time after putting it off for
    quite a while.  I hope it proves useful to some people.  I'm not sure what
    I'm going to do about the updating of this guide, if any.
Version 1.01 – June 20, 2004
    I made some minor changes throughout the guide.  That is all.
